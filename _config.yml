  Hi, I'm Ruby, a Health Data Science CDT DPhil student at the University of Oxford. I am currently working in the Quantitative Biomedical Imaging research group, using deep learning techniques to predict how a cancer patient will respond to treatment. I am funded by Cancer Research UK.
  
  I am also a big advocate for women in STEM, and am passionate about improving the representation of women in our fields. This year I am the Vice President of Oxford Wom*n in Computer Science, and am an ongoing instructor for Code First Girls, a charity that teaches women how to code.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Deep Learning</mark> and coding (<mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>).

          My PhD researches state of the art deep learning techniques in order to apply these in a medical setting. I am currently trying to predict a colocrectal cancer patient's response to radiotherapy from digital histology slides taken from tissue biopsies. To do this, I am developing techniques to enhance the context of the histology images, using the tissue morphology to aid predictions. I am exploring ways in which we can make such predictions more interpretable to clinicians, in order to move towards clinical translation of a deep learning model.
